This is a test document and nothing more.

Now I have to check if images work properly or not in the mark down.

![](.//media/image1.png){width="6.5in" height="5.625in"}

Working with images is not working

Now let’s try some math equations.

$$a^{2} + b^{2} = c^{2}$$

Math equations are not working then lets try styles and table.
